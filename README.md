# The Roger Faulkner Archive 

Roger Faulkner was an entrepreneur, inventor, and activist with Motor Neurone Disease (often called ALS/MND or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). Roger left a remarkable impact on all those he touched. He was a visionary who saw the world as a beautiful, vibrant canvas, despite all his adversity. Throughout his life, Roger's mission was to use his skills in science and the power of invention to make the world a better place.

In a **X**-Year battle with ALS, Roger passed abruptly on the morning of 14 June 2021 due to a medical accident after less than a week in his new nursing home. Roger left **X** people and family members behind, including his beloved **X**-year-old son, Rajeev. This is detailed in a later section of this archive. 

The purpose of this project is to categorise, organise, and centralise Roger's life work and internet footprint. One of Roger's biggest worries was having his invetions and ideas die with him. We (members of Roger Faulkner's community, _livinginawheelchair_) seek to preserve and continue Roger's legacy through the continued maintanence and recording of his work, documents, visions, and ideas through this website.

This is an active project and a collaborative effort by the _livinginawheelchair_ community and the Roger Faulkner Foundation. We are actively looking for contributors, and the source code for this website is contained [here](https://github.com/Living-in-a-Wheelchair/rogerfaulknerarchive.com).

Throughout his life, Roger created various patents and artefacts of intellectual property. This archive is essentially a centralised collection of all Roger's work. This means that the original licensing and rights all belong to Roger Faulkner and follow the license of the respective work that we describe. For instance, any mention of one of Roger's patents in this archive is simply a reference to his work, and all rights are preserved by that respective patent. None of Roger's work, unless specified, is governed by an open source license - the goal of this project is to simply make his ideas accessible and viewable to the public.
